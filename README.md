make sure you everything installed:
cd backend
npm install
cd ../frontend
npm install

to run everything: 
cd frontend (make sure you are in frontend folder)
npm run dev

modify your .env folder to match your system
I have everything set as password for ease
If I create a user in a group called Lilly Moreau its username is deafult lmoreau and I set their password to password
I can use that to login to the website
